üìù Project Description:
This repository contains the solution for Task 2: Deep Learning - Image Classification as part of the CodTech Internship. The goal of this task was to develop and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset.

CIFAR-10 is a well-known benchmark dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images across 10 distinct classes (such as airplane, automobile, bird, cat, etc.). This task required building a deep learning model, training it on the dataset, evaluating its performance, and saving it for future use.

üîß CNN Workflow:
‚úÖ 1. Data Loading & Preprocessing:
The CIFAR-10 dataset was loaded using tensorflow_datasets, and images were normalized (pixel values scaled between 0 and 1). The data was batched, shuffled, and prefetched for performance optimization.

‚úÖ 2. Model Building (CNN):
A custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was built using the Keras Sequential API. It included multiple convolutional layers, max pooling, a flatten layer, and two dense layers with ReLU and softmax activations.

‚úÖ 3. Model Training:
The model was compiled with Adam optimizer and sparse categorical cross-entropy loss. It was trained over 10 epochs using both training and validation datasets.

‚úÖ 4. Evaluation & Visualization:
The training performance was tracked and visualized through accuracy and loss graphs. A confusion matrix and classification report were generated using sklearn to evaluate the model‚Äôs predictions on test data.

‚úÖ 5. Model Saving & Loading:
The trained model was saved in .keras format inside the models/ directory and successfully reloaded later to confirm persistence and usability.
